# Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate

This repository contains my work for the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate**, a 7-course series that covers foundational concepts in data science, statistics, machine learning, and regression analysis. Each folder contains the final project for each course.

## Course Overview:

1. **Course 1: Foundations of Data Science**
   - This course is mostly  conceptual.

2. **Course 2: Get Started with Python**
   - [Project for Course 2] - I have uploaded the project for this course. It demonstrates my Python skills and how I applied them to solve real-world problems.

7. **Course 7: Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone**
   - [Capstone Project] - I will upload the capstone project once I have completed it.

## Folder Structure:
Each course has a subfolder with its corresponding project. The projects include the Jupyter notebooks, Python code, and any data used in the project.

Feel free to explore the repository to check out my progress in each of these courses. The Capstone Project will showcase my overall learning from the entire series.
